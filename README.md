# Domestic Flight Reservation
This is a domestic flight reservation website built in PHP and MySQL as a final project for the Web Technology course in college.

Project built in collaboration with [Amr Bumadian](https://github.com/AmrBumadian).

The website consists of two main types of users:
## 1- Customer:
The one who views the current flights available in the system and books a flight of his choice, he can
also cancel a booked flight or update his profile info.
## 2- Admin:
The one who can control the aircrafts and flights in the system, adding new aircrafts and flights or
updaing aircrafts and flights that are currently in the system, he can also view users' feedbacks and messages.
